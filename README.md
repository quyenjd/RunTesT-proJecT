# RunTesT proJecT

An efficient and simple tool that helps with test-generating (in preparation of competitive programming problems).

## Installation

1. Download the source.
2. Compile the main file `runtest.cpp` (with `-lpsapi`). I used [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org) 17.12 with TDM-GCC (version 5.1.0, 32 bit, SJLJ).
3. Download and install the latest [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) command line version (7za) to where you put the compiled `runtest.exe` file if you want the program to add all the generated test files into a ZIP file.
4. Run and enjoy!

## How to use

You just need to read and follow the instructions from the program carefully. Believe me, it's very easy to use.

## Changelog

I'm too lazy to write the changelog. It will be interesting for you to discover it yourself!

## Bugs

Before reporting bugs, make sure that you have followed the instructions strictly.

The program is not installed error handling so misbehavior can be caused by changes without any significant reason.
